# smart-shovel
A smart shovel programmed using C++ on an Arduino Nano for controlling a GPS-powered, weight-sensing shovel. The C++ on the Arduino Nano controls the GPS module, weight sensor, and SD card reader. The 3D-printed structural components for the physical prototype were designed using Fusion 360. The ultimate goal was to create a weight-sensing shovel that detects the GPS location of any garbage collected.

## Built Using
### C++
C++ was used for all the sensory and control functionalities of the Arduino Nano. 

### Arduino Nano
The Arduino Nano acted as the central hub for collecting and storing information gathered by the shovel about its surrounding environment.
